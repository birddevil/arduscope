# arduscope
An oscilloscope, probably arduino-based, which is to be built in terms of the Complex Embedded Systems lab training.

## Tasks
### Technical
* Decompose the problem into parts
* Understand project limitations
* Choose the hardware implementation (and justify the choice).
* Write firmware
* Test the result

### Organizational
* Clarify the licensing issue. Are there any restrictions? May we use an open-source license? (and do we want to use it?)
* **(due on 30th April)** Prepare a public talk: present the rough architecture, system limitations, hardware requirements.
