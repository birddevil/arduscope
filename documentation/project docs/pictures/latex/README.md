In this directory reside the source codes of latex-generated pictures related to the `arduscope` project.
If you want to (re)-compile any picture, make any necessary changes and compile `Tikz-palette` with pdflatex (you can use MikTeX 2.9 on Windows).
If you want more convenience, then take the `.default` files, remove the extensions and run the `.tcp` file with Texniccenter.
